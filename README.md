# IPRefresher
This batch file releases the IP address and asks the DHCP for a new one.

I created this batch file because I ran into more than 5 computers needing a new IP address or a flushed DNS during troubleshooting and got tired of making a new batch file everytime.
This batch file will only work on Windows computers.
